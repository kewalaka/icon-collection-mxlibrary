# Azure Icon Collection mxlibrary for diagrams.net (formerly draw.io)

## Introduction

This repository contains several mxlibrary sets converted from [Azure Icon Collection](https://code.benco.io/icon-collection/),
which is prepared for use as shape libraries on [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net) (formerly draw.io) application.
You can easily import them into your documents on the app of online / desktop / VSCode extension versions.

The [svg2mxlibrary](svg2mxlibrary) program which yaegashi used to convert SVG icons into an XML file is also available.

## How to use

The generated mxlibrary files are stored in `mxlibrary` branch in the repository.
You can get them [via GitHub web site](https://github.com/kewalaka/icon-collection-mxlibrary/tree/mxlibrary).

To open [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net) with the mxlibrary imported, use the following links.
The mxlibrary imported will be persisted.

To use the mxlibrary with [the desktop app](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio-desktop),
you should first [download mxlibrary files](https://github.com/kewalaka/icon-collection-mxlibrary/archive/mxlibrary.zip),
then drag and drop XML files on the app.

To use the mxlibrary as custom libraries with
[Visual Studio Code Draw.io Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio),
add the following snippet in your settings.json.

```json
    "hediet.vscode-drawio.customLibraries": [
        {
            "entryId": "'Official' Azure Icons Set",
            "libName": "Azure Icons",
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kewalaka/icon-collection-mxlibrary/mxlibrary/azure-icons.xml"
        },
        {
            "entryId": "Azure Docs",
            "libName": "Azure Docs",
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kewalaka/icon-collection-mxlibrary/mxlibrary/azure-docs.xml"
        },
        {
            "entryId": "'CDS' Azure Icons Set",
            "libName": "Azure CDS",
            "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kewalaka/icon-collection-mxlibrary/mxlibrary/azure-cds.xml"
        },
        {

## How to convert SVG icons to mxlibrary

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to build and run [svg2mxlibrary](svg2mxlibrary).

You can run [convert.sh](convert.sh) to clone <https://github.com/benc-uk/icon-collection>
and convert icon collection folders into mxlibrary files in "out" directory.

```console
$ npm install --no-save svg2mxlibrary
$ ./convert.sh

- [Azure Icon Libraries for Diagrams.net (Draw.io)](https://github.com/pacodelacruz/diagrams-net-azure-libraries) by [pacodelacruz](https://github.com/pacodelacruz) directly inspired yaegashi to make this mxlibrary repository with the latest Azure Icon Collection.
- [How yaegashi used mxGraph instance in node.js](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55711473/4937930) is a Stack Overflow question that was a critical clue for me to successfully develop [svg2mxlibrary](svg2mxlibrary).
